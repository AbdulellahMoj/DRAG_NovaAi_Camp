    "# 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "## Why Your Model is Only as Good as Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you something they don't mention in most ML tutorials: you're going to spend way more time cleaning data than building models. Some say 80% of the work is data preparation, 20% is the actual modeling. Today, you'll see exactly why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Stop Sign Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're training a self-driving car. You feed it thousands of images to learn from. But there's a problem - someone mislabeled the data. Stop signs are labeled as \"Green Light\". Traffic lights are labeled as \"Pedestrian Crossing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens? Your model learns perfectly... learns the wrong thing. It will confidently run every stop sign it sees because that's what the data taught it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Models Fail (The Real Reasons)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model performs poorly, there are usually two culprits:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Data** (90% of the time)\n",
    "- Missing information (blank cells, null values)\n",
    "- Wrong labels or measurements\n",
    "- Outliers that don't make sense\n",
    "- Inconsistent formats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Algorithm** (10% of the time)\n",
    "- Wrong model for the problem\n",
    "- Poor hyperparameters\n",
    "- Not enough training\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice something? Data quality problems are 9 times more common than algorithm problems. Yet most beginners obsess over which algorithm to use while ignoring their messy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Fix Today\n",
    "\n",
    "Real data is messy. Always. Whether it's from sensors, user input, or manual entry, you'll deal with:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Values**\n",
    "- Someone forgot to fill in their age\n",
    "- A sensor failed and recorded nothing\n",
    "- Data got corrupted during transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale Problems**  \n",
    "- House size: 500-5000 square feet\n",
    "- Age: 1-100 years\n",
    "- Price: $50,000-$5,000,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Without fixing this, your model will think a house that's 10 years newer is basically the same, but 100 square feet smaller is a huge difference. The numbers overwhelm each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Data**\n",
    "- Models need numbers, not words\n",
    "- \"Yes\" and \"No\" need to become 1 and 0\n",
    "- Categories like \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\" need numerical representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Practice Dataset\n",

    "# 2. The Three Pillars of Supervised Learning\n",
    "## Building Your First Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does a Machine Actually \"Learn\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about teaching a kid to estimate house prices. You show them examples:\n",
    "- \"This 2,000 sq ft house sold for $300,000\"\n",
    "- \"This 1,500 sq ft house sold for $225,000\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough examples, they pick up the pattern: bigger houses cost more. They can now estimate prices for houses they've never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning works the same way. Instead of a kid, we have a mathematical function. Instead of intuition, we have three components working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Every supervised learning algorithm - whether it's simple linear regression or a complex neural network - has these three pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Model (the learner)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the mathematical function that makes predictions. For linear regression, it's simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Predicted Price} = w \\times \\text{SquareFeet} + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w$ = weight (how much each square foot adds to price)\n",
    "- $b$ = bias (base price when square feet = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of $w$ and $b$ as knobs we need to adjust to make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Loss Function (the evaluator)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how wrong our predictions are. For regression, we typically use Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation: for each house, find the error (actual - predicted), square it, then average all the squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why square? Because errors can be positive or negative, and we don't want them canceling out. Also, squaring punishes big mistakes more than small ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The Optimizer (the adjuster)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the algorithm that adjusts those knobs ($w$ and $b$) to minimize the loss. Most commonly: Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're blindfolded on a hillside and trying to get to the valley. You:\n",
    "- Feel the slope under your feet (that's the gradient)\n",
    "- Take a step downhill\n",
    "- Repeat until you can't go any lower\n",
    "\n",
    "That's gradient descent. The slope tells you which direction makes the loss smaller, and you keep adjusting until you can't improve anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to predict house prices from square footage. You'll see all three components in action:\n",
    "- Create a model\n",
    "- Train it (optimizer finds best $w$ and $b$)\n",
    "- Evaluate it (use loss function to measure performance)\n",
    "- See how well it predicts on data it's never seen\n",

    "\n",
    "**Component 1: The Model**\n",
    "- Used Linear Regression: $\\hat{y} = wx + b$\n",
    "- The `.fit()` method found optimal $w$ and $b$\n",
    "- Model discovered the relationship: Price ≈ $150 per square foot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 2: Loss Function**\n",
    "- Used MSE to measure prediction quality during training\n",
    "- Also calculated MAE (easier to interpret) and R² (percentage explained)\n",
    "- Lower loss = better model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 3: Optimizer**  \n",
    "- Hidden inside `.fit()` - it used the Normal Equation\n",
    "- Automatically found the $w$ and $b$ that minimize MSE\n",
    "- No manual tuning needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Lessons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train/test split is essential** - Never evaluate on training data\n",
    "2. **Multiple metrics tell the full story** - MSE, MAE, and R² each reveal something different\n",
    "3. **Visualization matters** - A plot can show problems that metrics miss\n",
    "4. **These three components appear in ALL supervised learning** - Neural networks, random forests, SVMs... they all have a model, loss function, and optimizer\n",

    "## 5.6 Part 5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation solves the \"lucky split\" problem. Instead of trusting one random train/test split, you test your model multiple times with different splits and average the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "With k-fold cross-validation, you split your data into k equal parts. Then you train k models, each time using k-1 parts for training and 1 part for testing. Every data point gets tested exactly once and trained on k-1 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Final Score} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Score}_i \\pm \\text{Standard Deviation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Stratified Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For imbalanced data (like 95% healthy, 5% sick), regular k-fold might create unbalanced folds. Stratified k-fold maintains the same class ratio in every fold, making results more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing K:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **k=3**: Fast but less reliable. Good for quick experiments.\n",
    "- **k=5**: The sweet spot. Fast enough and reliable enough for most projects.\n",
    "- **k=10**: More accurate but takes 2x longer. Use for final validation.\n",
    "- **k=20+**: Very slow. Only for small datasets or when you need maximum precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight from cross-validation is the standard deviation. A low standard deviation means your model is stable across different data splits. A high standard deviation means your model's performance varies a lot - that's a warning sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is essential when you have limited data and need to squeeze out every bit of training and testing value. It's standard practice for model evaluation in most machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Skip It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have millions of samples, a single train/test split is usually fine. Also skip it for time series data (use time-based splits instead) or when training is extremely expensive (like large deep learning models).\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line: cross-validation gives you confidence in your model's performance. Instead of one score that might be lucky, you get multiple scores that reveal the true pattern."
