    "## Prepare Data for Sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** Sklearn expects data in a specific format. This trips up many beginners!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "**X (Features) must be 2D:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = df[['Square_Feet']]  # Double brackets [[ ]] → Creates a 2D DataFrame\n",
    "# Shape: (5, 1) - 5 samples, 1 feature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**y (Target) can be 1D:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = df['Price']  # Single brackets [ ] → Creates a 1D Series\n",
    "# Shape: (5,) - 5 samples\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 2D for X?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn needs to handle multiple features, so it always expects a table structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**One feature (our current example):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = [[1000],   # House 1: 1000 sq ft\n",
    "     [1500],   # House 2: 1500 sq ft\n",
    "     [2000]]   # House 3: 2000 sq ft\n",
    "# Shape: (3, 1) - 3 houses, 1 feature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple features (we'll see this later):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = [[1000, 3, 2],  # House 1: [sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms]\n",
    "     [1500, 4, 2],  # House 2\n",
    "     [2000, 5, 3]]  # House 3\n",
    "# Shape: (3, 3) - 3 houses, 3 features\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** Always use double brackets `[[]]` for features, even with just one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** Sklearn wants a table (DataFrame), not a list (Series)."

    "## Extra Tips: Best Practices for Using Sklearn ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Always Split Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents overfitting and gives you honest performance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Train ONLY on Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.fit(X, y)  # Don't use all your data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model needs to see fresh data at test time, not data it's already seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluate on Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)  # Too optimistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Test performance is what actually matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Multiple Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)\n",
    "    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))\n",
    "    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each metric shows something different about your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Compare Training vs Test Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "    train_r2 = model.score(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "    test_r2 = model.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if abs(train_r2 - test_r2) > 0.1:\n",
    "        print(\"Warning: Possible overfitting!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Big gap between training and test scores? Your model memorized instead of learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Use Consistent Random States\n",
    "\n",
    "    train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes your results reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Check Your Data Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"X shape: {X.shape}\")  # Should be (n_samples, n_features)\n",
    "    print(f\"y shape: {y.shape}\")  # Should be (n_samples,)\n",
    "\n",
    "Catches issues before they become confusing errors."
